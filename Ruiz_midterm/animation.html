            <h2> Boricua History</h2>

            <h3>Flag History</h3>
            <p>The flag of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Bandera de Puerto Rico), officially the Flag of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Bandera del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. 'Flag of the Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'), represents Puerto Rico and its people. It consists of five equal horizontal stripes, alternating from red to white, with a blue equilateral triangle based on the hoist side bearing a large, sharp, upright, five-pointed white star in the center. The white star stands for the archipelago and island, the three sides of the triangle for the three branches of the government, the blue for the sky and coastal waters, the red for the blood shed by warriors, and the white for liberty, victory, and peace. The flag is popularly known as the Monoestrellada (Monostarred), meaning having one star, a single star, or a lone star. It is in the Stars and Stripes flag family.</p>

            <p>The Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico identified the colors of the flag as red, white, and blue but failed to specify any shade, leading to an ongoing debate about the tonality of the color blue. Contemporaneous secondary oral sources claimed that the light blue used on the Lares flag was retained. However, the only Lares flag authenticated by a written primary source from 1872 features a dark blue. Moreover, primary sources from 1895 and 1897 have also established that the original color adopted and used by members of the committee was a dark blue.</p>

            <h3>Island History</h3>
            <p>Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ("Rich Port City"). Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city. The island's name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898. The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises. The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila.</p>

            <p>The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ("Free Associated State of Puerto Rico"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Spanish official name was suggested by its architect Luis Muñoz Marín and adopted by a constitutional assembly on July 25, 1952.</p>

            <h3>Dance History</h3>

            <p>Salsa, one of the most internationally recognized music and dance forms associated with Puerto Rico, is a dynamic and energetic style that originated from the New York-based Cuban and Puerto Rican diaspora in the 1960s. Beyond that recognizable rhythm, salsa dancing has also become incredibly popular, with different varieties and footwork patterns. Salsa, typically danced in a 4/4 time signature, encompasses various styles, including Cali Style (from Colombia), Cuban Style, Cumbia Style, Mambo Style, New York Style, L.A. Style, and Puerto Rican Style.</p>

            <p>Bomba is a traditional Afro-Puerto Rican music and dance genre that emerged during the 17th and 18th centuries. Plena, considered to be folk music, was inspired by both Spaniard and African traditions, emerging from Ponce and the Southern region of the Island during the late 19th century. Both genres share rhythmic drumming and improvised lyrics, addressing social and political issues. While bomba has paired down call-and-response vocals and focuses on the dialogue between singer and drummer, plena features more of a story-telling element, with some popular lyrics that have stood the test of time, although it started with improvised lyrics.</p>

            <p>One of the most popular music genres from Puerto Rico, reggaetón is equal part catchy beats and lively dancing. Born from reggae, dancehall, salsa, and hip-hop, this urban music genre is best enjoyed on the dance floor. From its humble origins at house parties on cassette tapes to the world stage, you can hear this music bumping from speakers on the Island almost every day at any time. Reggaetón is easy to dance, either alone, next to others in a group, or with a partner. It usually involves grinding and hip movements, usually set to the beat of the music, ranging from traditional perreo to the faster movements of doble paso. </p>
