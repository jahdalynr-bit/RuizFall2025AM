			<h1>Puerto Rico Culture</h1>

			<h2>A brief glimpse of the culture</h2>

			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>One of my person favorite dishes is arroz con gandules, this dish is usually eaten whenever, well that's the case in my family but is definetly cooked more throughout the holidays. Here's some more info on the dish: "This dish is mainly served during the Christmas season or for special occasions.[4] The sofrito is the most important part of seasoning the rice. In Puerto Rican cooking sofrito, which is used as a base in many recipes, typically consists of the following ingredients: Recao, cilantro, yellow onions, garlic, aji dulce peppers, red bell pepper, and cubanelle peppers. Sofrito is blended into a watery or paste consistency. There are many family recipe variations of sofrito.[5] The sofrito is cooked with the rice, the idea is for the rice to absorb the sofrito for maximum flavor." -Wiki</p>

			<h3>Music and Artists</h3>
			<p>Music is a huge part of our culture. One of the artists that highlights what Puerto Rican Culture truly is, is bad bunny. He highlights to the public our culture. Especially in his most recent tour in which raised a huge amount of money for the island. So I thought I would add light to his most recent album: "On December 5, 2024, Bad Bunny released the lead single "El Clúb",[111] followed by the second single "Pitorro de Coco" and the announcement of his new album Debí Tirar Más Fotos on December 26, 2024.[112] On January 5, 2025, he released his seventh album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, stating that it "recommits me to Puerto Rico"; it contains many collaborators representing a range of Puerto Rican styles.[113] After the release of Debí Tirar Más Fotos, Bad Bunny announced No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí, a 30-date residency which will take place at San Juan's José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, (also referred as "El Choli") during July 2025 - September 2025 with the first nine dates exclusively for Puerto Rico residents.[114][115] The residency occurred during hurricane season in the Atlantic ocean—a period when tourism drops by 25% to 45% and lodging prices fall by as much as 50% according to tourism agency Discover Puerto Rico. According to Moody Analytics the residency is expected to draw ~600,000 attendees and have a direct economic impact of $250 million. Moody also estimates total spending, which includes purchases not directly related to shows, will reach $400 million and caused the firm to raise its 2025 economic forecast from 0.3% growth to 0.4%.[116]"-Wiki</p>

			<h3>Island and Towns</h3>
			<p>One of the main towns on the island is San Juan. Some of my own family is from this part of the island. Here's some info on the great San Juan: "Puerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, founded in 1496,[5] and is the oldest European-established city under United States sovereignty. Several historical buildings are located in the historic district of Old San Juan; among the most notable are the city's former defensive walls, Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San Cristóbal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. These historic sites were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Today, San Juan is Puerto Rico's most important seaport[7] and is one of the island's most notable financial, cultural, and tourism centers. The population of the metropolitan statistical area, including San Juan and the municipalities of Bayamón, Guaynabo, Cataño, Canóvanas, Caguas, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Carolina and Trujillo Alto, is about 2.443 million inhabitants; thus, about 76% of the population of Puerto Rico now lives and works in this area.[8] San Juan is also a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. The city has been the host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American Games; 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games; events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics; the Caribbean Series and the Special Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010."-Wiki</p>
