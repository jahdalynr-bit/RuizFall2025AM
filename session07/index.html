                    <h3>About The Mushroom</h3>
                    <p>Hydnellum peckii is a fungus in the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. The unusual appearance of the young fruit bodies has earned the species several descriptive common names, including strawberries and cream, the bleeding Hydnellum, the bleeding tooth fungus, the red-juice tooth, and the Devil's tooth.</p>

                    <p>The fruit bodies typically have a funnel-shaped cap with a white edge, although the shape can vary greatly. Young, moist fruit bodies can "bleed" bright red guttation droplets. Although the fruit bodies are readily identifiable when young, they become brown and nondescript with age. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies.</p>

                     <p>TThe species is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). It is mycorrhizal, forming mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses. They are considered inedible, but the guttation droplets contain atromentin, a pigment with anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. -Wiki</p>

                    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
                    <p>This gooey red liquid is actually a sap of sorts caused by a process called guttation. When the soil surrounding the fungus' root system becomes very wet, it may force water into the roots through the process of osmosis. This creates pressure throughout the organism, which eventually builds up enough to force liquid to the surface of the fungus. Although scientists have not yet decided what this liquid is exactly, they know it appears red thanks to a pigment found within the fungus. In addition to its most graphic feature, the Bleeding Tooth Fungus has small toothlike projections underneath the mushroom cap, where its spores are produced. When young, the mushroom's surface is covered in soft "hairs" that can give it a velvety texture, but these fall off as the mushroom matures. As with similar fungi, beneath each mushroom lies an interconnected mass of mycelia, its root system. The mycelia can spread widely just beneath the surface of the forest floorâ€”up to 11 feet away from where the mushroom appears. -WWC</p>

                    <p>Hydnellum diabolus (the species epithet is given the neuter diabolum in some publications)[5][15] has a very similar appearance, so much so that some consider it and H. peckii to be synonymous; H. diabolus is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that is lacking in H. peckii.[16] The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: H. diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of H. peckii is thickened by a "definite spongy layer". Additionally, old specimens of H. peckii have a smooth cap, while H. diabolus is tomentose.[5] The related species H. pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, H. pineticola tastes "unpleasant", but not acrid.[7] Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike H. peckii, they do not have bulbous stems.[17] Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer DNA of several Hydnellum species placed H. peckii as most closely related to H. ferrugineum and H. spongiosipes.[18] Abortiporus biennis has no teeth but produces red droplets from exposed pores.[19] -Wiki</p>

            <h2>Did you know?</h2>
            <p>The Bleeding Tooth Fungus is not toxic, but tastes so bitter as to be inedible, despite one of its other names (Strawberries and Cream, because of its resemblance to a fruit danish). However, the mushroom is valued by natural dyers, who dry it and use it alone to create a beige dye or combine it with mordants (substances, such as allum or iron, that cause a dye to set into fabric and other surfaces) to create blue-green hues. Scientists have found that extracts from the Bleeding Tooth Fungus contain the chemical compound atromentin, which like heparin, can be used as an anti-coagulant to keep blood clots from forming and which also has anti-bacterial properties and may be an option for treating the most common strain of bacterial pneumonia. Researchers are also looking at another chemical found in the Bleeding Tooth Fungus, thelephoric acid, which may someday be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.-WWC</p>
