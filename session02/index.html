    <p>Cortinarius violaceus, commonly known as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a fungus in the webcap genus, Cortinarius, for which it serves as the type species. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and has undergone several name changes. 
        It is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct cystidia. There are some populations that seem to prefer 
        deciduous trees and others that prefer pines, but no genetic divergence between the two has been found. When identified as taxonomically separate from the 
        deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, C. 
        hercynicus, or as a subspecies, 
        C. violaceus ssp. hercynicus. 
        Other populations once identified as C. violaceus or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as 
        C. palatinus, C. neotropicus, C. altissimus, C. kioloensis and C. hallowellensis. (source:Wikipedia)

    <p>"There were also the Jack-Fallowers, who were said to have faces that were almost entirely made of mushroom. 
    But nobody in the graveyard had ever seen one, and they were probably invented by the ghosts to give the graveyard a bit of the 
    colour of mushrooms that didn't grow there, but also some of the colour of the children who used to live there, in a time when there were still children in the graveyard."</p>
